In this repository, I have developed a model capable of calculating the probability of a patient developing a particular disease based on the features outlined below:

Drug 1 (mg), (Drug 2),
Main disease Status,
Family Size, Age,
Severity of the Relevant Disease,
Surgery,
Smoking Status,
Pack-year,
Diet Type,
Gender, Race

The models constructed in this analysis include Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.


I trust this clarifies the contents of the repository. Should you have any further inquiries, please feel free to reach out to me at kianaamany@gmail.com.
